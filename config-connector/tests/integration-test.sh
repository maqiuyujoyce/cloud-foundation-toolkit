# TODOs:
# * Name to be determined.
# * It is the main entry point for running all the tests.

# * It should run all the defined tests under tests/ folder.
# * It should check whether KCC has been installed properly before running the tests.
# * In the future we may want to have a public GCP folder and automate the full 
#   workflow including creating the project, installing KCC, etc.
